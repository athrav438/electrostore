    <p>
        We understand that circumstances may arise where you need to cancel an order or request a refund. Electrostore strives to make this process as straightforward as possible while ensuring fairness to all parties involved.

Order Cancellation: You may cancel your order within 24 hours of purchase without incurring any cancellation fees. To initiate cancellation, please contact our customer support team with your order details. We will confirm the cancellation and process any eligible refunds promptly.

Refund Eligibility: Refunds are available for eligible products returned in their original condition within 6 days of delivery. To qualify for a refund, items must be unused, undamaged, and in their original packaging. Certain products may be exempt from our standard refund policy, such as personalized or custom-made items.

Return Process: To initiate a return, please log in to your Electrostore account and submit a return request. Our customer support team will review your request and provide instructions for returning the item(s). You are responsible for securely packaging the product(s) and covering return shipping costs unless the return is due to our error or product defect.

Refund Processing: Once we receive and inspect the returned item(s), we will process your refund within 6 business days. Refunds will be issued to the original payment method used for the purchase. Please note that financial institutions may require additional time to process refunds, and we appreciate your patience during this period.

Restocking Fees: In some cases, returned items may be subject to a restocking fee. This fee covers the cost of inspecting, repackaging, and restocking the product(s) for resale. Restocking fees, if applicable, will be deducted from your refund amount.

Damaged or Defective Products: If you receive a damaged or defective product, please notify us immediately to arrange for a replacement or refund. We may request photographic evidence of the damage to expedite the resolution process. Damaged or defective items will be replaced at no additional cost to you.

Refund Status: You can check the status of your refund by logging in to your Electrostore account or contacting our customer support team. We will provide updates on the refund process and notify you once the refund has been issued.

Policy Updates: Electrostore reserves the right to update or modify our Cancellation/Refund Policy at any time without prior notice. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting on our website. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for updates.
